"~~~~~~~~~~Things to Do~~~~~~~~~~~~"

"""

1. GUI_Books (same for GUI_Movies)
    * Function needs adjusted so that the database inquiry uses all given values without 
      without requiring five arguments

2. GUI_Checkout (Optional)
    * The window successfully checks out items and places them under a patron's list, but 
      the function doesn't check to see if the patron already has 3 items out. It requires an 
      honest input. Database doesn't update with limit being reached either. Currently the
      database shows that Bob Ross has four items checked out
    * Query doesn't check to see if item_id exists.
